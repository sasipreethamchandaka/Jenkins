# Jenkins Master–Slave (Controller–Agent, SSH method) Setup Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the Jenkins Master–Slave (Controller–Agent) architecture implemented on AWS EC2 instances, including execution of pipelines on private servers using **Controller-Agent and SSH methods via a Load Balancer**.

This setup improves scalability, security, and performance by distributing workloads across multiple agent nodes.

## Key Concepts

- Jenkins is installed **only on the Master**
- Slaves (Agents) execute jobs assigned by the Master
- Communication between Master and Agents happens via **SSH**
- Pipelines are routed to agents using **labels**
- Supports execution on **private servers via Load Balancer**

---

## EC2 Instances Created

1. Jenkins Master (EC2)
2. Slave-1 (Controller-Agent)
3. Slave-2 (SSH Agent)
4. Optional additional slaves for scaling

---

## Jenkins Master Setup

- Installed:
  - Java
  - Jenkins
  - Git
  - Terraform
- Jenkins unlocked using:


  ```
         
    ## Private Jenkins Master Setup

     - Jenkins Master deployed in private subnet
     - Load Balancer created and attached
     - Target Group configured
     - Allowed traffic:
     - Port: `8080`
     - Protocol: `HTTP`

           http://<load-balancer-dns>:8080
  ```

- Recommended plugins installed
- Master used only for orchestration

---

## Agent Node Configuration

### Slave-1 (Controller-Agent Method)

- Node Name: `slave-1`
- Type: Permanent Agent
- Executors: `1`
- Remote Root Directory: `/home/ec2-user`
- Label: `dev`
- Launch Method: Launch agent by connecting it to the controller
- Free Disk Space Threshold: `200 MB`


**Notes**
- Java and Git installed on agent
- Node verified online before execution

---
### Slave-2 (SSH Agent Method)

- Node Name: `slave-2`
- Type: Permanent Agent
- Executors: `1`
- Remote Root Directory: `/home/ec2-user`
- Label: `test`
- Launch Method: Launch agents via SSH


#### SSH Configuration
- Host: `<private-ec2-ip>`
- Credentials:
  - Username: `ec2-user`
  - Authentication: SSH private key (.pem)
- Host Key Verification Strategy:
  ```
    Non-verifying Verification Strategy
  ```

## Pipeline Execution Using Labels

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        label 'dev'  # 'test'        --------------node1, node2, node3 
    }

    parameters {
        choice(
            name: 'ACTION',
            choices: ['apply', 'destroy'],
            description: 'Select Terraform action'
        )
    }

    stages {
        stage('Terraform Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/sasipreethamchandaka/Terraform_aws.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Terraform Init') {
            steps {
                dir('Basics_foundation-files') {
                    sh 'terraform init'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Terraform Plan') {
            steps {
                dir('Basics_foundation-files') {
                    sh 'terraform plan'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Terraform Apply/Destroy') {
            steps {
                dir('Basics_foundation-files') {
                    sh "terraform ${params.ACTION} -auto-approve"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

    - Pipeline runs only on matching label
    - If no agent matches, job remains pending

    ## Benefits

    - Secure execution on private servers
    - Scalable architecture
    - Efficient resource utilization
    - Supports Docker, Terraform, and application deployments
    - Label-based job control

    ## Resume / LinkedIn Line

     **Executed Jenkins pipelines on private servers using Controller–Agent and SSH methods via Master connected through Load Balancer.**

    ## Interview Summary

    Jenkins Master manages scheduling and orchestration, while SSH-connected agents execute pipelines securely on private EC2 servers using label-based routing.
